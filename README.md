### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luciano.
I am graduated in systems analysis and development and I have been looking to learn a little more about full stack and mobile web development. I'm learning ReactJS, React native, nodeJS, TypeScript, Docker and other technologies. I have more affinity in ReactJS but I am open to challenges.
